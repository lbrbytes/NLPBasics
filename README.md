# NLPBasics
This project illustrates NLP Basic steps using NLTK
- TOKENIZATION 
It is based on the NLTK tokenizer with regular expressions. These expressions take into consideration
actually currencies and dates; but may be extended in several ways depending on your needs
- LEMMATIZATION
It is based on WordNet lemmatizer.
- STOP WORDS & POS
They are based on the "english" language. They are actually paramatrized and can be easily switched 
to any other language
